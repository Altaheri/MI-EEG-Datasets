# Public EEG-based motor imagery (MI) datasets

The document summarizes publicly available MI-EEG datasets released between 2002 and 2020, sorted from newest to oldest. This document also summarizes the reported classification accuracy and kappa values for public MI datasets using deep learning-based approaches, as well as the training and evaluation methodologies used to arrive at the reported results.
